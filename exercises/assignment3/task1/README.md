# Explanation of Solution

Follow up questions:

1. Why is pshared set to 0 in sem_init here, and what would change if it were 1?
2. Suppose we accidentally initialized all seven semaphores to 1. What behavior would you expect and why?
3. Whatâ€™s the downside of using a single global semaphore for all cases instead of a chain (hint: how would you wake the right next thread)?
4. Extra thought: could you solve the same ordering with a mutex + condition variable (pthread_cond_t) instead of semaphores? What would the shared state be?
