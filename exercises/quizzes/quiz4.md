# Question 1
Consider a set of processes with arrival times and burst times as follows:

| Process | Arrival Time (ms) | Burst Time (ms) |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| P1 | 0 | 5 |
| P2 | 2 | 3 |
| P3 | 4 | 2 |

Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process using FCFS scheduling.

---

# Question 2
For a round-robin scheduling with time quantum of 4 milliseconds, and the following processes with arrival times and burst times:

| Process | Arrival Time (ms) | Burst Time (ms) |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| P1 | 0 | 10 |
| P2 | 1 | 3 |
| P3 | 2 | 5 |
| P4 | 3 | 2 |

Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.

---

# Question 3
Using a non-preemptive priority scheduling algorithm, consider the following processes with arrival times, burst times, and priorities:

| Process | Arrival Time (ms) | Burst Time (ms) | Priority |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| P1 | 0 | 6 | 3 |
| P2 | 1 | 4 | 1 |
| P3 | 3 | 2 | 2 |
| P4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process.

---

# Question 4
For a set of processes with arrival times and burst times as follows:

| Process | Arrival Time (ms) | Burst Time (ms) |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| P1 | 0 | 8 |
| P2 | 1 | 4 |
| P3 | 2 | 1 |
| P4 | 3 | 3 |

Calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process using preemptive SJF scheduling.
